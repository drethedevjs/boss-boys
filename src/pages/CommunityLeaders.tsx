          Teaching young men leadership skills builds responsibility, sound
          decision-making, and the ability to communicate and collaborate under
          pressure. These skills help them manage conflicts, earn trust among
          peers, and act with integrity — traits that translate into stronger
          relationships, better opportunities, and more resilient communities.
          Fostering empathy, accountability, and problem-solving early makes
          them reliable contributors at school, work, and in civic life.

          Leadership should be framed as everyday influence rather than fame or
          public recognition. Emphasize actions like listening, following
          through on commitments, lifting others up, and taking responsibility
          for shared outcomes; these are the quiet but powerful forms of
          leadership that don’t require being on TV. Reinforce that leading well
          often means serving others, modeling values, and consistently doing
          the right things when no one is watching.
