          B.O.S.S. is a leadership program at Tates Creek Middle School for
          African American boys who could use the extra relational support from
          Black men. The program is designed to start these young men on the
          path to becoming community leaders, and, eventually, loving husbands
          and great fathers.

          American's past has set African Americans on a rough future. One piece
          of evidence is abundance of single parent homes in black communities
          which effects to wholistic development of the children therein. This
          amplifies the traditional issues that children face such as identity,
          belonging, and the like. The organizers of B.O.S.S. believe that
          reversing this legacy is not solely won on Capitol Hill, in
          statehouses, or through school politics.

          We believe wholeheartedly that Black men must deny the luxury of
          selfish ambition in order to step into roles as fathers to the
          fatherless, spiritual surgeons who help heal deep wounds, and large
          stone pillars supporting the often-complicated black family dynamic.

          B.O.S.S. is not intended to be a behavior center for "bad kids." We
          are not looking to focus on students labeled as problematic.
          Nonetheless, they are welcome to participate. Our focus is primarily
          on boys of color who want to grow and/or those who recognize a void in
          themselves because of rejection from family members or peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          B.O.S.S. is not a tutoring program. We believe our boys are capable of
          meeting—and exceeding—the academic expectations placed on them. When a
          student struggles academically, we tend to view that as a symptom of a
          larger absence of steady, positive black male leadership in their
          lives.
