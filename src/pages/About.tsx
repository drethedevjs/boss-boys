          B.O.S.S. is a leadership program at Tates Creek Middle School for
          African American boys who could use the extra relational support from
          Black men. The program is designed to start these young men on the
          path to becoming community leaders, and, eventually, loving husbands
          and great fathers.

          It is no secret that the centuries of treacherous history experienced
          by African Americans in the United States have left a legacy that
          continues to affect Black people—especially Black men. The organizers
          of B.O.S.S. take this reality to heart and believe that reversing this
          legacy is not won on Capitol Hill, in statehouses, or solely through
          school politics.

          We believe wholeheartedly that Black men must deny the luxury of
          selfish ambition in order to step into roles as fathers to the
          fatherless, spiritual surgeons who help heal deep wounds, and large
          stone pillars supporting the often-complicated Black family dynamic.

          B.O.S.S. is not intended to be a behavior center for "bad kids." We
          are not looking to focus on students labeled as problematic. That
          said, our mission does include reaching boys who are acquainted with
          in-school suspension because some of those students are there
          precisely because they are missing the consistent, positive support
          our program provides.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we may organize study halls, B.O.S.S. is not primarily a
          tutoring program. We believe our boys are capable of meeting—and
          exceeding—the academic expectations placed on them. When a student
          struggles academically, we view that often as a symptom of a larger
          absence of steady, positive Black male leadership in their lives.
