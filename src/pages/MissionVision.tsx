      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To instill in boys of color a strong sense of responsibility and value
        for their community in which they live that causes them to go be agents
        of change in there community by being a faithful husband, a selfless
        father, and a loving neighbor.
      </p>

      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Our chief desire is for black boys to see themselves and the world
        around him in a more positive way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We desire to see black communities where black men are mentoring black
        boys and where, eventually, it will be more common to see fathers
        mentoring their own sons.
      </p>
      <p>
        We desire to see our boys view education as having immense value and for
        them to use it to help shape their communities.
