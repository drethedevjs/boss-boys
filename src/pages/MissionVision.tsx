        We mourn the plight African American boys. We desire to see a major
        change in the way they see themselves and the world around him.

      <p>
        We desire to see black communities where black men are mentoring boys of
        color and where, eventually, it will be common to see fathers mentoring
        their own sons.
      </p>
      <p>
        We desire to see our boys view education as having immense value and for
        them to use it to help shape their communities.
