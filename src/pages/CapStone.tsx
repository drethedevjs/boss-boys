      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout a students BOSS experience, they will learn leadership skills
        through group and private discussions as well as be given opportunities
        to exercise what they've learned. All the students who remain in the
        program up to the 8th grade must lead a group discussion with the other
        members in order to receive a certificate of completion.
      </p>
      <p>We make this a requirement for a few reasons:</p>
      <p>
        <span className="font-good-times! bg-boss-gold rounded-2xl pl-3 dark:text-white">
          ONE.
        </span>{" "}
        We want the boys to earn their certificate not just be remaining but
        putting forth effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="font-good-times! bg-boss-gold rounded-2xl pl-3 dark:text-white">
          TWO.
        </span>{" "}
        We want to give them the experience as a facilitator and instructor.
        They will get to see the peak of their growth from being a 6th grade
        learner to an 8th grade leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="font-good-times! bg-boss-gold rounded-2xl pl-3 dark:text-white">
          THREE.
        </span>{" "}
        We want them to experience what their teachers experience as instructors
        so that they gain a new respect for them and their role in the life of
        the school.
      </p>
