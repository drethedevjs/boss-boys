        Unfortunately, not all students interested in being a part of the
        program can participate. In order to show value to the students we make
        them earn their spot in the group.

      </section>

      <section id="informational">
        <h3>Informational</h3>
        <p>
          We first start with an informational where I meet with all the 6th
          grade boys of color. I give a brief introduction as to who I am, why
          I'm there and what BOSS is.
        </p>
        <p>
          The informational then becomes interactive where I'm asking the boys
          questions and having them move around.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="signatures">
        <h3>Signatures</h3>
        <p>
          After the informational, I give them a sheet of paper with a brief
          introductory paragraph about BOSS and a space for signatures. The boys
          needs to get signatures from their parent/guardian, and a school
          administrator. On the back side, there's a grid of 100 squares. They
          are challenged to get 100 signatures from anyone with a pulse and an
          opposable thumb. They have two days to complete this and to turn their
          papers into the Guidance office.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="interviews">
        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          After turning in their signatures, they will be invited to be
          interviewed by me (and potentially an 7th/8th grade BOSS member). They
          are expected to dress in business or business casual attire. This is a
          very low stress 10 minute interview.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="offer-to-join">
        <h3>Offer to Join</h3>
        <p>
          After the students are selected, they will receive and offer to join
          BOSS via a letter. At that point, students can decided whether they
          want to continue with us or not.
