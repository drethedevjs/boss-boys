        Andre Thomas is software engineer. His connection with North Augusta
        Middle Schools comes by him being a local. He is also a small business
        owner, owning a photography and videography business that serves
        families and small businesses alike.

        Over the past few years, Thomas has had a growing burden to help his
        fellow African Americans in his community, particularly through working
        with young boys of color (tweens and teens). His burden grows deeper as
        he obtains a more thorough understanding of his Christian faith,
        realizing that the Lord hates the “dishonest scales” imposed by humanity
        (the elite over the oppressed), and also realizing that the Lord loves
        (restorative) justice. So, while personally witnessing the legacy of
        racism, he can't help but to take action himself—believing that if
        common people do not stand up to correct the effects of this legacy then
        the problem will persist.

        By God's grace, in college, Thomas met his first mentor, Curtis Woods,
        who drastically changed his life through what some call “life on life”.
        He did not meet Curtis through joining a special program; instead, it
        was Curtis' willingness to stretch out an informal hand of fellowship
        that fostered this mentoring relationship. Slowly Mr. Woods would set
        Thomas on a completely different path—a new path—which has lead him to
        be that man he is today—a man of action. And because of this informal
        mentorship, Thomas is most interested in the mentoring of this kind. He
        desires not to come into a volunteer space, serve time, and leave, but
        to be holistically immersed and fully engaged in the lives of young
        black men.

        Thomas is an alumni of Kentucky's HBCU, Kentucky State University (KSU).
        He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics. During his four
        years there, he served as a member, team leader, and President of KSU's
        Baptist Campus Ministry. During his senior year, he served as 1st
        Attendant to Mr. KSU. He also tutored students in math at KSU's Academic

        Thomas lives in Graniteville, SC with his lovely wife of six years,
        Porsha Thomas, and their kids. They together, as the Lord wills, hope to
        breathe life into the community in which they live.
