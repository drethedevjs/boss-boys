        Andre Thomas is a software engineer with a deep commitment to his
        community. His involvement with North Augusta Middle School stems from
        both his local ties and his genuine passion for making a positive impact
        on young lives in the area.

        Over the past few years, Thomas has had a growing burden to help boys of
        color in his community. It stems from his faith that propels him to help
        restore broken communities because the Lord loves (restorative) justice.
        So, while personally witnessing the legacy of colonial slavery, he can't
        help but to take action himself—believing that if common people do not
        stand up to correct the effects of said legacy then the problem will
        persist or even worsen.

        By God's grace, in college, Thomas met his first mentor, Curtis Woods,
        who drastically changed his life. He did not meet Curtis through joining
        a special program; instead, it was Curtis' willingness to stretch out an
        informal hand of fellowship that fostered this mentoring relationship.
        Slowly Woods would set Thomas on a completely different path—a new
        path—which has lead him to be that man he is today. And because of this
        informal mentorship, Thomas is most interested in the mentoring of this
        kind. He desires <b>not</b> to come into a volunteer space, serve time,
        and leave, but to be holistically immersed and fully engaged in the
        lives of young men.

        Baptist Campus Ministry. During his senior year, he served as 1st
        Attendant to Mr. KSU. He also tutored students in math at KSU's Academic
