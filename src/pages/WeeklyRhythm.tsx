          <h2>Check Ins</h2>
          <p>
            Each of us will say our name and our current mood or emotion. For
            example, “My name is Bryan and I'm checking in as excited!” or “My
            name is Cameron and I'm checking in as frustrated.”

          <h2>Highs and Lows</h2>
          <p>
            Each boy will share a high point of the day — something that brought
            them the most joy that day (like receiving a 100% on a math test).
            Then they will share a low point — something that brought them the
            most frustration or sorrow, such as being sent out of the classroom
            for bad behavior or being bullied.

          <h2>Miscellaneous Business</h2>
          <p>
            This is a short time for us to share upcoming events and trips in
            which we'll participate, dive into a current event that popular news
            outlets are discussing, collectively help one another think through
            situations that happened at school or at home, or introduce new
            ideas or concepts as part of their development and progression.

          <h2>Lesson</h2>
          <p>
            This will be our group discussion time where we will talk about a
            specific topic of our choosing.
